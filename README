CSE 506 - Operating Systems: Assignment 1

Files:
./xmergesort.c			- user level program for testing
./sys_mergesort.c		- system call of merge sort
./Makefile 			- to produce executable .o and related files
./install_module.sh		- to install sys_mergesort
./Kernel.config			- baseline kernel config file that < 1000 lines


Installation:
1. To make life easier, I already modified install_module.sh, so that we can use simply:
   
   - sh install_module
   
   to install our system call without any manu make.  Of course, people can also use treditional way to make and insmod our merge sort function.


Usage:
1. The basic command is:  
    
   - ./xmergesort [-uaitd] output input1 input2
 
   The option of u, a, i, t, d are well tested and The default is -a. NOTICE: -a and -u are exculsive, so that if both these two flags appear in command, if will return error without executing any mergesort. On the other hand, we accept some reasonable combination such as -ud or -ai.

2. The default buffer size of input and output are 4KB.



Implementation:
1. For validation, we use getname to check if the paths from command are all exist, all check if there have enough space for us to create/ open files.

2. For mergesort, each time we read buffer sizes of line, and than compare each line not only with lines from another file, but also with the line before it, so that I can produce results with different flags like t.  In such way, we can efficiently check the validity and write file at the same time, compare to check the input first then writing, which is more I/O comsuming.
